# Rogue-Like-Dinosaur-Game
This is a text-based "rogue-like" game developed in Java programming language applying SOLID object oriented design principles, ensuring application maintainability and extensibility. 

## The game has two modes: 
- Challenge, where the player wins if they get the specified number of eco points within the
specified number of moves, and loses if they do not (i.e. if they do not earn enough, or if they
have spent too much)
- Sandbox, where the plays may play the game as long as they want to
In the beginning of the game the player is located on one of the two maps near the vending machine, where they may buy different items. While moving around the maps, the user may interact with dinosaurs, find items, such as fruits, hay, etc and earn or spend eco point by performing various actions.

## To run the application
In order to run the application, you should run the ``` Application.java ``` file, which may be found in ```src/game```.
